# What is it

This code is an example of Bot for Whatsapp Web.

I have create this piece of code just to know if was viable. It is just a concept, just a test.

# How to use it?

1. Open `chrome`, then visit `web.whatsapp.com`
2. Press `F12`, click at `console`
3. Copy all the `wabot.js` code  and paste into console. Don't worry, you can trust me, I am a loveeeely person.

4. Installed!

5. Now ask for your friend to send you this message: `@HELP`


#### But... What are the limitations?

A lot of limitations!

1. As you are handling DOM direcly, you can't process hundred of messages at once. Yowsup is much better at this subject.

2. You can't start a message with a unknown person. You can only answer them, mainly because you can't add a new fellow on the Contacts list on Whatsapp Web.

2. You have to install Whatsapp on your phone, connect it on Wifi and keep it charging all the time. So you have to have a cellphone exclusively for this Bot. You will need a computer with chrome running as well. But that's the main objective: In order to avoid being detect as a Bot, so you have to play this boring cat-and-rat game.
